# Counting Stars
## fits image practice + time series
- mainly followign tutorials, did some experimentation

## counting stars in the horsehead nebula
(same file tackling the same problem, but different verions saved; v1 = day 1, v2 = day 2, etc.)
- v1: gradient analysis 
- v2: using a circle 
- v3: annulus aperture 
- v4: different kinds of annuli, tweaking the snr ratio calculations

## annulus folder
- differently sized annuli that were used to test out the coutning stars algorithm
